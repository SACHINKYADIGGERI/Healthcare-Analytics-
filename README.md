# Healthcare-Analytics-
A healthcare analytics project utilizing visualizations to explore correlations between BMI, blood pressure, diabetes, and other health factors across age groups.
Healthcare analytics can utilize visualizations to reveal important patterns in diabetic vs. non-diabetic patients. A histogram can show the distribution of Body Mass Index (BMI) across different age groups, while a single bar chart can illustrate the percent distribution of patients by BMI type (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese). A bar chart comparing blood pressure levels (Normal, Elevated, High) against diabetic status (Diabetic, Non-diabetic) can highlight correlations between these factors. Additionally, a heat map can display various health factors like cholesterol, glucose, and physical activity across age groups, providing insights into key health risks in specific demographics.
